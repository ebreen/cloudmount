# Requirements: CloudMount

**Defined:** 2026-02-02
**Core Value:** Users can mount cloud storage buckets as local drives and access them seamlessly in Finder with a beautiful status bar interface for management.

- [x] **FILE-03**: User can write files to mounted bucket — v1.0
- [x] **FILE-04**: User can delete files from mounted bucket — v1.0
- [x] **FILE-05**: File metadata (size, modification time) displays correctly in Finder — v1.0

### Status Bar Interface

- [x] **UI-01**: Status bar icon shows mount status (mounted/unmounted) — v1.0
- [x] **UI-02**: Menu displays list of configured buckets with mount status — v1.0
- [x] **UI-03**: Menu shows disk usage for each mounted bucket — v1.0 (protocol wired, sends None)

- [x] **UI-05**: "Settings" option opens configuration window — v1.0

### Configuration

## v2 Requirements

### Multi-Bucket Support

- **MULTI-01**: User can configure and mount multiple buckets simultaneously
- **MULTI-02**: Each bucket has independent mount point

### Auto-Mount

- **AUTO-01**: Auto-mount configured buckets on app startup
- **AUTO-02**: Auto-mount on system login (optional)

### Enhanced UI

- **UI-06**: Recent files/favorites in menu
- **UI-07**: Connection status indicators per bucket
- **UI-08**: Upload/download progress indicators

### Generic S3 Support

- **S3-01**: Support for AWS S3 buckets
- **S3-02**: Support for other S3-compatible providers (Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces)
- **S3-03**: Custom endpoint configuration for S3-compatible APIs

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Smart synchronization / offline mode | HIGH complexity, requires local cache + background sync |
| Client-side encryption | Cryptomator integration, defer to v2+ |
| File locking | S3 doesn't support POSIX locking, complex to emulate |
| Windows/Linux support | macOS-only for v1, cross-platform later |
| Real-time sync badges in Finder | Requires Finder extension, complex to implement |
| Multi-user collaboration | Out of scope for personal-use tool |
| Bandwidth throttling | Nice to have, not essential for MVP |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| MOUNT-01 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| MOUNT-02 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| MOUNT-03 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| MOUNT-04 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| FILE-01 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| FILE-02 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| FILE-03 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| FILE-04 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| FILE-05 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| UI-01 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| UI-02 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| UI-03 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| UI-04 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| UI-05 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| CONFIG-01 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| CONFIG-02 | Phase 4 | Complete |
| CONFIG-03 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| CONFIG-04 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| ERROR-01 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| ERROR-02 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| ERROR-03 | Phase 1 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v1 requirements: 21 total (18 original + 3 error handling)
- Mapped to phases: 21
- Unmapped: 0

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 21 of 21 v1 requirements
**Adjusted:**
- UI-03 (disk usage): Protocol wired end-to-end but sends None — B2 has no bucket size API, actual computation deferred
**Dropped:** None
